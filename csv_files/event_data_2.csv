"The event was a total disaster, nothing was organized."
There was a large turnout at the venue.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
The event started at 6 PM as scheduled.
Many people attended the sessions.
Poor planning ruined the entire experience for everyone.
Everything was smooth and enjoyable.
Snacks were available at the stalls.
It was completely mismanaged and chaotic throughout.
"Total mess, everything went wrong at the event."
Amazing setup and great lighting.
The weather remained clear throughout.
"Great experience, would attend again!"
Absolutely disorganized and stressful from start to finish.
Loved the energy and performances!
